## Webpack-ts
Boilerplate repo for webpack development with typescript + eslint

## Setup

### Development

```
# Install package.json dependencies

$ npm install

# Run webpack-dev-server

$ npm run dev
```

### Production

```
# Install package.json depencies

$ npm install

# Bundle project with webpack

$ npm run build

# Run bundled code on /dist

$ npm run start
```

## Optional dependencies
These depedencies are included as optional since they aren't necessary for the boilerplate project but can make development easier.
- Jest (Unit testing)
